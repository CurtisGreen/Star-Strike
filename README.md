### TODO

-   Give port as command line argument
-   Have a screen showing "waiting for player 2" or at least a message
-   Running out of ammo the first time doesn't stop you from shooting
    -   It stops you for all following reloads
-   Lower default volume
-   Have a button to go back to the main menu or quit from the game
-   Sometimes invaders = -1 for unkown reasons
-   Startup screen shows both screens even before pressing play
